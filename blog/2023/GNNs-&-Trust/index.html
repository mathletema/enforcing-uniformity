Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), with their capacity to learn from graph-structured data, offer a promising approach to this predictive task. This project proposes to explore the effectiveness of GNNs in predicting social ties and to examine whether these predictions can serve as a proxy for trust between individuals in a social network.</p> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>With the proliferation of online social platforms, understanding and predicting social connections has become a topic of increased interest for both academic research and practical applications. Traditional machine learning methods often fall short in capturing the complex patterns within graph-structured data inherent to social networks. Graph Neural Networks, however, are uniquely suited for this purpose due to their ability to leverage node feature information and the topological structure of graphs.</p> <h2 id="objective">Objective</h2> <p>The primary objective of this project is to implement and evaluate a GNN model that can predict whether a social tie will form between two users in a social network. Secondary objectives include:</p> <ul> <li>Investigating the features that are most predictive of tie formation.</li> <li>Assessing the role of network topology in influencing prediction accuracy.</li> <li>Evaluating the feasibility of using tie predictions as a proxy for trust.</li> </ul> <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2> <p>We will employ a publicly available social network dataset, pre-process it to suit our needs, and construct a GNN model using a framework such as PyTorch Geometric. The model will be trained to predict links between nodes, with performance measured by accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.</p> <h2 id="data">Data</h2> <p>The dataset will be sourced from a reputable public repository (SNAP) that contains social network graphs with node and edge attributes. Suitable candidates include datasets from platforms such as Twitter or academic collaboration networks.</p> <h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected Outcomes</h2> <p>The project aims to demonstrate the capability of GNNs in accurately predicting social ties. The expected outcome is a model with robust predictive performance that could potentially be deployed in a real-world social network setting to suggest new connections or detect communities.</p> <h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Week 1</strong>: Literature review and dataset procurement.</li> <li><strong>Week 2</strong>: GNN architecture definition</li> <li><strong>Week 3</strong>: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis.</li> <li><strong>Week 4</strong>: Implementation of the GNN model, initial training, and hyperparameter tuning.</li> <li><strong>Week 5</strong>: Final model training, evaluation, and analysis of results. Preparation of the project report and presentation.</li> </ul> <h2 id="summary-and-literature">Summary and Literature</h2> <p>This project stands to contribute valuable insights into the application of Graph Neural Networks to social network analysis, specifically in the prediction of social ties which may correlate with trust. The findings could have implications for the design of social media platforms, recommendation systems, and the broader field of network science.</p> <p>This project on leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for predicting social connections, serving as proxies for trust, is substantiated by insights from works in the field. The study ‘A Deep Graph Neural Network-Based Mechanism for Social Recommendations’ by Guo and Wang, alongside ‘Rec-GNN: Research on Social Recommendation based on Graph Neural Networks’ by Si et al., both underscore the efficacy of GNNs in social recommendation systems. These articles illustrate how GNNs can effectively decipher complex social interactions, an aspect crucial to this project’s focus on trust prediction within social networks. Furthermore, ‘A Survey of Graph Neural Networks for Recommender Systems: Challenges, Methods, and Directions’ by Gao et al. offers a comprehensive landscape of GNN applications in recommendation scenarios, highlighting both challenges and future directions. This survey provides a broad understanding of GNN methodologies and potential pitfalls, thereby enriching the approach towards modeling trust through social connections. Collectively, these sources not only offer theoretical backing but also practical insights into the application of GNNs in understanding and predicting the dynamics of social networks.</p> <hr/> </article> </div> </div> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha256-fgLAgv7fyCGopR/gBNq2iW3ZKIdqIcyshnUULC4vex8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@4/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js"></script> <script defer src="/staging/assets/js/masonry.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.0.6/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-EdPgYcPk/IIrw7FYeuJQexva49pVRZNmt3LculEr7zM=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/staging/assets/js/zoom.js"></script> <script defer src="/staging/assets/js/common.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script> <script defer src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script> </body> </html>
