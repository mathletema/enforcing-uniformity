Due to the attention mechanism, ViTâ€™s have the ability to learn more uniform short and long-range information. Despite this benefit, ViTs suffer from an increased computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$ with respect to the input patch number. This suffices for low-resolution images, but quickly becomes burdensome for high-resolution applications. There have been many advances seeking to balance between the computational complexity and the short and long-range spatial dependencies. One popular example is the Swin Transformer<d-cite key="Liu2021"></d-cite> that employs a convolutional-like approach by limiting self-attention to local windows and linearizing the complexity - at the cost of losing long-range information. The Swin Architecture can be seen in <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a>. Other approaches have used down-sampling techniques such as average or max pooling over the keys and values to reduce the complexity. However, these processes are non-invertible resulting in the loss of high-frequency components. In order to preserve the amount of information we extract from our image, recent work has incorporated a Wavelet block as a drop-in replacement for these down-sampling operations<d-cite key="Yao2022"></d-cite>. The Wavelet block consists of an invertible transform that breaks an image down into high and low frequency spatial components. Due to the inverse nature of such operations, high-frequency components of the image will be preserved. Another novel approach applies a hybrid attention scheme consisting of local and global self-attention modules. In each module, a global query token is generated and interacts with the local key and value tokens<d-cite key="Hatamizadeh2023"></d-cite>.</p> <p>These new approaches highlight the pursuit to preserve high-frequency features and long-range information - while simultaneously enabling increased performance. They entertain creative new ideas that warrant further investigation to completing characterize their potential in relavant domains. Therefore, I propose to investigate and analyze such architectures in MRI reconsturction where maintaining fidelity of the resultant image is essential to an individualâ€™s health.</p> <p>In more detail, I will investigate how each architecture can be coincided with the image restoration framework, SwinIR<d-cite key="Liang2021"></d-cite>. First, I will investigate the Wave-ViT, as it utilizes the long-studied Wavelet transform, which historically initiated the rapid acceleration of MRI images in the late 2000s when the field of compressed sensing met deliberate undersampling<d-cite key="Lustig2007"></d-cite>. The GC-ViT will also be studied in its ability to provide adequate MRI reconstruction while preserving detail. Both architectures will be compared to the most popular attention reconstruction network, SwinMR<d-cite key="Huang2022"></d-cite>. The data utilized will come from the field standard, fastMRI<d-cite key="Zbontar2018"></d-cite>, which was released by MetaAI and NYU.</p> <div class="col-sm"> <a name="figure-1"></a> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-11-08-diaz-proposal/swinvit-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-11-08-diaz-proposal/swinvit-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-11-08-diaz-proposal/swinvit-1400.webp"/> <img src="/staging/assets/img/2023-11-08-diaz-proposal/swinvit.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Figure 1: Swin Transformer Architecture. </div> </div> <h2 id="proposal-outline">Proposal Outline</h2> <ol> <li>Introduce Vision Transformers and their advantages and shortcomings when compared to CNNs <ul> <li>The comparison will be visually illustrated.
