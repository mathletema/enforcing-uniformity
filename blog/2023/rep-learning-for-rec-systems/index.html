<h1 id="final-project-proposal">Final Project Proposal</h1> <p>Much of our social media and content platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Netflix, etc. utilize recommender systems for provided personalized content and feeds. A crucial factor in delivering good recomendation system having an expressive embedding of user data and history.</p> <p><strong>I want to explore different representation learning algorithms to generate different embeddings to be used for recommendations / clusters and evaluate their accuracy.</strong></p> <p>The application I will use to test this on will depend on the data availability. One domain I was initially thinking of was movie recommendation due to the prevalence of open-source data.</p> <p>Some ideas that I have read about:</p> <ul> <li>Use large language models directly as a resource for recommending user content based on past likes and history</li> <li>Use graph / transformer neural networks by modeling user history as sequential data</li> <li>Use contrastive learning / autoencoders to build embedding vector of user past likes and history</li> </ul> <h3 id="potential-references">Potential References:</h3> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.18608.pdf">Embedding in Recommender Systems: A Survey</a></li> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01343.pdf">Collaborative Large Language Model for Recommender Systems</a></li> </ul>
