This is especially true in the field of pathology, where only a few cells in a biopsy image may contain disease features. Because these images are so large, it is often advantageous to examine them at multiple scales <d-cite key="chenScalingVisionTransformers2022"></d-cite>. In September of 2023, it was shown that in addition to positional embeddings, using scale embeddings for image analysis tasks with deep learning can be incredibly beneficial for analyzing satellite imagery <d-cite key="reedScaleMAEScaleAwareMasked2023"></d-cite>. We see a clear parallel between analyzing vast amounts of satellite imagery and analyzing large medical images in digital pathology to make a diagnosis.</p> <p>In the field of renal pathology, electron microscopy (EM) is a crucial imaging modality for diagnosing diseases such as amyloidosis and thin membrane disease, amongst many others. A pathologist has to analyze up to 90 EM images per patient, at vastly different scales (ranging from 2 to 100 nanometers per pixel), to make a diagnosis. While deep learning methods have been proposed for automatically classifying a disease from single images in a supervised fashion <d-cite key="hackingDeepLearningClassification2021, zhangDeepLearningbasedMultimodel2023"></d-cite>, in the field of medical imaging labels suitable for supervised training often do not exist. For example renal pathologists generate a full report in unstructured text, addressing the EM findings in the context of the patient’s clinical background. Therefore, in order to make a scalable AI system which can take advantage of the vast amounts of unstructured medical data, self-supervised methods are necessary. We propose</p> <ol> <li>to use an unsupervised vision-language model to create an expressive and scalable shared embedding space between textual descriptions for diagnoses and EM images</li> <li>to learn a patient-level single embedding corresponding to multiple images, in the way that a pathologist would use multiple images to make a diagnosis and</li> <li>to add a learnable scale embedding after extracting their features, in order to make the image encoder scale-aware.</li> </ol> <p>Through nefarious means, we have obtained a dataset containing 600,000 renal EM images corresponding to 15,000 patients, along with a written diagnostic report for each patient. We will adapt the CLIP architecture for multiple-instance scale-aware contrastive learning between the images for each patient and their diagnostic report. Following self-supervised CLIP pretraining, we will evaluate the model on the following tasks: Zeroshot diagnosis on a held-out test set, retrieval at the patient-level and image-level, and linear probing of the learned image features. We will compare the performance of our model to a baseline model which does not use scale embeddings.</p> <p>Deliverables:</p> <ul> <li>A baseline multiple-instance CLIP model without scale embeddings</li> <li>A multiple-instance CLIP model with scale embeddings</li> <li>AUC and balanced accuracy on the zero-shot diagnosis task and linear probing task</li> <li>Recall@K on the retrieval tasks</li> </ul> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-11-09-project-proposal/Fig1-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-11-09-project-proposal/Fig1-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-11-09-project-proposal/Fig1-1400.webp"/> <img src="/staging/assets/img/2023-11-09-project-proposal/Fig1.png" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> </div> <d-bibliography src="/staging/assets/bibliography/2023-11-09-project-proposal.bib"></d-bibliography> <script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js" repo="iclr-blogposts/2023" issue-term="pathname" theme="github-light" crossorigin="anonymous" async> </script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha256-fgLAgv7fyCGopR/gBNq2iW3ZKIdqIcyshnUULC4vex8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> </body> </html>
