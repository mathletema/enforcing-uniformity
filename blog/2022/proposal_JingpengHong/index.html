Especially, the sequential structure of session or click-logs are highly suitable for the inductive biases provided by recurrent/convolutional neural networks <d-cite key="hidasi2016sessionbased"></d-cite>. In such setting, the input of the network is a sequence of consumers’ search behavior, while the output is the predicted preference of the items, i.e. the likelihood of being the next in the session for each item. The ultimate goal is to pinpoint the optimal product for the consumer, thereby increasing sales. An example of where this could be applied is the “featured product” on platforms like Amazon.</p> <p>However, a challenge with this model is the sparsity of data. It’s well-known that the products in retail has the “long-tail” feature. Only a small fraction, say 5%, of a site’s products are ever browsed or bought by customers, leaving no data on the remaining products. Additionally, customer sessions tend to be brief, limiting the amount of information we can get from any one individual. This issue is particularly acute for “data-hungry” models, which may not have sufficient training data with enough variation to accurately match products with customers.</p> <p>My proposed solution to this issue is to recommend products that also encourage further exploration. Economic studies have shown that certain types of information structure can motivate customers to consider more options, harnessing the “wisdom of crowds” <d-cite key="kremer2014implementing"></d-cite><d-cite key="che2018recommender"></d-cite>. Imagine two products: recommending the first leads to a 5% purchase likelihood, while the second has a 4% chance. But the second item prompts the customer to look at 5 additional products. This extra data allows our model to learn more, potentially enhancing recommendations for this and other customers in the future. Therefore, we might choose to recommend the second product to generate more user-driven training data.</p> <h2 id="plan">Plan</h2> <p>For the first step, we aim to improve Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) by incorporating multi-task learning, focusing on two objectives: i) predicting the likelihood of an item being the next viewed in a session ii) predicting the number of items a customer will browse next. Undertaking this task requires more knowledge in RNNs, particularly LSTMs, and multi-task deep learning.</p> <p>For the second step, our goal is to gather established models like matrix factorization (MF) and deep learning-based collaborative filtering (CF) to use as benchmarks. I intend to carry out an extensive review of the literature to select popular methods for comparison.</p> <p>For the final step, we plan to create simulations of consumer search behavior to observe how they interact under various conditions by the recommender system. This involves defining specific search behaviors and determining whether our approach indeed prompts more extensive searching by the user. Subsequently, we can assess the value of the additional data generated by the consumer’s search activity resulting from our recommendations.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> </div> <d-bibliography src="/staging/assets/bibliography/2022-12-01-distill-example.bib"></d-bibliography> <script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js" repo="iclr-blogposts/2023" issue-term="pathname" theme="github-light" crossorigin="anonymous" async> </script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha256-fgLAgv7fyCGopR/gBNq2iW3ZKIdqIcyshnUULC4vex8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> </body> </html>
